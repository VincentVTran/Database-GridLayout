**Introduction** <br/>
This is was one of my first attempt with creating a database via
.txt files (9/12/18). I used a PrintWriter and Scanner along with a few nested
for-loop algorithm to add and remove rows. The program is quite broad in terms
of applicable use so it could potentially be used for future projects.
